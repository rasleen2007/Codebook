# Rasleen's Java Journey 🚀

Hey there! I'm **Rasleen Kaur**, just starting my adventure into the world of **Java programming**. 🎉

This repo is where I upload all the little Java programs I create every day — from simple input exercises to solving random questions and challenges. It's like my digital notebook, but way cooler and on the internet! 😄

## 📝 Why am I doing this?

- To track my progress 📈  
- To have a backup and save space on my computer 💾  
- And because sharing is caring — maybe someone out there will find these useful 🙌

## 💡 What's Inside?

I’m organizing everything by topic and problem — from basics to logic-based problems.

| Topic         | What you'll find                         |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Basics      | Input/output, variables, conditionals     |
| 🔁 Loops       | `for`, `while`, `do-while` examples       |
| 🔢 Numbers     | Odd/Even checks, logic, etc.              |
| 🔧 Practice    | Random daily problem-solving practice     |
| 📦 OOP         | Coming soon... Classes and objects!       |
